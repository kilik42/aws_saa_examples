AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you automate the setup and management of AWS resources by using infrastructure as code (IaC).

ðŸ§± What does that mean?
Instead of manually creating AWS services like EC2, S3, VPC, etc., you write a template file (in YAML or JSON) that describes what you want, and CloudFormation will build it for you.

Think of it like giving AWS a blueprint â€” and it builds the whole house (infrastructure) for you.
